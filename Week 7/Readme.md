# Air Quality Data (Tableau) - Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project focused on analyzing India's air pollution levels using the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board. The primary objective was to build a comprehensive Tableau Dashboard that provides insights into air quality changes over the years and their potential correlation with environmental policy shifts in India.

## Business Objectives

- Explore air quality changes in relation to shifts in environmental policies.
- Provide a granular view of air pollution levels across different states or regions in India.
- Facilitate user interaction with the data through customizable views and filters.

## Dashboard Components

1. **Map Visualization:**
   - Utilized geographical maps to visually represent air quality levels across different states or regions.
   - Color-coded map markers based on the air quality index (AQI) for enhanced clarity.

2. **Time Series Charts:**
   - Created time series line charts to illustrate changes in air quality over the years.
   - Grouped data by months and years to identify patterns and trends.

3. **Policy Change Timeline:**
   - Integrated a timeline component showcasing key environmental policy changes in India.
   - Highlighted these events on the timeline for correlation observation with air quality variations.

4. **Filter Options:**
   - Implemented user-friendly filters for selecting specific states, periods, or pollutant types.
   - Provided flexibility for users to customize views based on their interests or research questions.

5. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Included comparative charts to showcase air quality comparisons between different states or regions.
   - Utilized bar charts and line charts to illustrate variations in air quality metrics.

6. **Top Pollutant Analysis:**
   - Identified and displayed the top pollutants contributing to poor air quality.
   - Utilized bar charts and pie charts to represent the proportion of each pollutant.

7. **Insightful Annotations:**
   - Utilized annotations to highlight specific data points, events, or trends standing out in the analysis.
   - Provided context and explanations for these annotations.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset, a clean version of the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data, includes dimensions such as Stn_code, Sampling_Date, State, Location, Agency, and measures like So2, No2, Rspm, Spm, pm2_5, etc.

## Key Air Quality Measurements

- **So2 (Sulfur dioxide):** Contributes to respiratory symptoms.
- **No2 (Nitrogen dioxide):** Linked to increased risk of respiratory tract infections.
- **Rspm (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter):** Produced from combustion processes, vehicles, and industrial sources.
- **Spm (Suspended Particulate Matter):** Emitted from combustion processes, vehicles, and industrial sources.
- **pm2_5 (Particulate Matter):** Particles with a diameter between 2 and 5 micrometers.

## Steps to Build the Dashboard

1. Connected to Data
2. Designed Dashboard Layout
3. Created Worksheets
4. Applied Filters
5. Implemented Interactivity
6. Integrated Timeline
7. Integrated Map
8. Tested and Refined
9. Documented Insights
10. Published and Shared

The completed dashboard provides a valuable tool for users to explore and understand India's air pollution levels, aiding in the identification of trends and correlations with environmental policy changes.
